# Referral Program

The Referral Program is an on-chain incentivized user onboarding tool that allows anyone to generate a referral link and share it with potential traders trying to onboard on the Buffer Platform.

Besides providing liquidity to the USDC vault, staking $BFR, or compounding your esBFR & MP, the referral program is a major avenue for earning #RealYield on Buffer by leveraging your network of traders.

The program is meant to incentivize the community to leverage their network to increase the number of Buffer users. Additionally, it adds inclusivity to the platform since you don’t have to be a pro-trader or a whale LP to benefit from being a part of the community. We have established a well-thought tier-based system to reward the most active members of the program.

### Tier System <a href="#6dab" id="6dab"></a>

* **Tier 1:**

When you enter the referral program, you automatically create a Tier 1 referral code. This code can be made by anyone entering the program.

* **Tier 2 and Tier 3**

Here are the parameters which once reached, level you up from tier 1 to tier 2, and subsequently to tier 3:

* To reach Tier 2: at least 15 active traders using your referral/week along with a combined volume of more than $5 Million.
* To reach Tier 3: at least 30 active traders using your referral/week and a combined volume of more than $15 Million.

Once your account fulfills the criteria for tier 2 or tier 3, you can fill out the form here, to request an upgrade: [https://forms.gle/dF5tntoLBFUEk8WKA](https://forms.gle/dF5tntoLBFUEk8WKA). Once the form is filled and submitted, please also open a ticket on [discord](https://discord.com/channels/842093373082959952/1019639084865568828) to follow up on the tier&#x20;

## Rewards: <a href="#c2cf" id="c2cf"></a>

* **Referer Rewards:**

For referrers of the program, the yield comes from the trades made by their referral network. If someone, a user uses your Referral Link to start trading on Buffer, you (the referer) receive a % from each trade of the referred person. Your referral tier determines the % of trader rebates you receive on each trade your referees make.

|                                  Tier |                           Trade Reward % |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|                               Tier 1  |                                  0.25%   |
|                               Tier 2  |                                    0.5%  |
|                               Tier 3  |                                    0.75% |

It’s important to highlight that for a new user to count as part of your referral tree, they must onboard the Buffer platform via your Referral Link and must connect their wallet on the dApp for the first time.&#x20;

If a user who has already traded on Buffer clicks on any Referral Link, this user’s volume will not count towards the Buffer Referral Program. Referral rewards have nothing to do with how good your traders are at trading (how much they win or lose) and are purely calculated based on the open position sizes from everyone (referees) that uses your link.&#x20;

Trader rewards are paid out in USDC and accrue in real-time.&#x20;

* **Referee Rewards:**

On the other hand, traders (the referee) who onboard the platform via a referral link to start trading on Buffer, will receive boosts on their payouts as rewards. Similar to referrer rewards, payout boosts received by the referees depend on their referral tier.

|                                Tier |                         Payout Boost  |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
|                             Tier 1  |                                    2% |
|                             Tier 2  |                                    5% |
|                             Tier 3  |                                    8% |
