<img width="1429" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-16 at 5 46 16 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126849045/225614661-153aa91b-146c-4cf9-8610-9ca6ba0785e1.png">

**The Practice mode can be used for:**

- getting accustomed to trading on a decentralized trading platform if you are new to DeFi or Buffer Finance
- testing the new features on the platform so that can be stress tested by our community before they are pushed to the mainnet. You can give us your feedback directly in the [testnet](https://discord.com/channels/842093373082959952/842093426279579729) channel on Discord.
- practicing your trading strategies as though you are live trading, but without using real USDC with value. 

## Step 1: Connect to Testnet 

Currently, the Practice Trading mode is live on 2 test networks: Arbitrum Goerli and Polygon Mumbai Testnet. Using the button on the top right-hand corner, select the preferred test network

## Step 2 — Get Goerli ETH Tokens/testnet MATIC 

### For using Practice Trading mode on Arbitrum Goerli:

To start interacting with the dApp, we first need some Test tokens i.e. Goerli ETH will be converted into AETH, and the other test token is USDC for placing trades on the testnet.

Many faucets are available online, but we recommend any of the three on the “Faucet” page.

Many faucets are available online, but we recommend any of the three on the “Faucet” page.

To fetch your test tokens, go to the “Faucet” page, and click on one of the three listed faucets of your choice:

**1: [Using the Goerli faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com/)**
Requires signing up/logging in using an Alchemy account.

**2: [Using the Goerli Mudit faucet](https://goerli-faucet.mudit.blog/)**
Requires users to make a tweet using the tweet template linked on the faucet’s page under the “How does this work?” section.
Users also need to paste their Ethereum address into the tweet template to receive funds using this faucet.

**3: [Using the Paradigm Multifaucet: https](/https:/faucet.paradigm.xyz/)**
Requires users to sign in with their Twitter accounts.

## Step 3: Bridge Goerli ETH to Arbitrum ETH or AETH
Return to the “Faucet” section on Buffer Testnet, and click on the “2. Bridge GoerliETH to AETH” button.

You will be directed to the Arbitrum Bridge. Connect your Goerli L1 ETH to Arbitrum’s Goerli Testnet on layer 2 by connecting your wallet to the Arbitrum Goerli bridge.

Click on “Move funds to Arbitrum Goerli,” and make sure to leave some Goerli ETH for transaction fees. Once the transaction has been executed, you should have AETH in your wallet after some minutes of processing.

### For using Practice Trading on Polygon Mumbai Testnet:

To start interacting with the dApp, we first need some Test tokens i.e. testnet MATIC. To get your test tokens, go to https://testnet.buffer.finance/#/faucet (make sure you are connected to Polygon Mumbai Testnet). Then, click on **'Claim Testnet Mumbai'**

This will direct you to the **[Alchemy Faucet](https://mumbaifaucet.com/)**, which requires signing up/logging in using an Alchemy account. 

## Step 4: Claim Testnet USDC
Once you've successfully claimed your testnet AETH tokens or testnet MATIC tokens, return to the “Faucet” section.

click on the “Claim 500 USDC” button and confirm the transaction. Once processed, you will have 500 Test USDC in your wallet.

Head back to the “Trade” page, and click **'Approve'** (one-time action needed) to allow testnet contracts to spend your test USDC.

You can now use the platform as you would on the Buffer mainnet!
