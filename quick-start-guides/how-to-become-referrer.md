# How to become a referrer?

### Step 1: Getting Started

If this is your first time on [https://buffer.finance/](https://buffer.finance/) before you start placing up/down trades, follow the **'**[**How to connect**](how-to-connect-to-the-app.md)**'** guide that will help you with connecting to the dApp, and preparing your wallet with sufficient ETH/MATIC for gas among other pre-requisites.

### Step 2: Create a referral code

To participate in the referral program, first, you need to create a referral code. To do that, navigate to https://app.buffer.finance/#/referral.

Click on **'Create your Referral'** and enter any combination of letters, numbers, and underscores to create a referral code. Click on **'Create'**.

_Note that referral codes are case-sensitive and that your code must be created on both Arbitrum as well as Polygon to earn trader rewards on both networks._

Once the referral code is successfully created, click on the copy icon next to the code to get your referral link, it should look something like this: https://app.buffer.finance/#/?ref='your\_code\_here'.

Once copied, you can share your referral link on any social media or communication platform. When a user clicks on your link, your referral code will be connected to their account. When a user (referee) under your referral network, makes a trade they will receive a payout boost depending on their tier and you (referer) will receive trader rewards on the referee's trade size. When the user makes a trade they would receive a discount and you would earn rebates from their trading fees.

You can track your overall rebate history including 'trading volume,' 'Total Referred Trades,' and 'Total Rebates Earned.'

Note: referee rewards and referer rewards are distributed in USDC both on Arbitrum and Polygon.

To understand referral tiers and rewards, use the '[Referrals](https://app.gitbook.com/s/as8muGJZvVrS0BgDB8hJ/\~/changes/3/rewards/referral-program)' page under the 'Rewards' section.

## How to use a referral code?

If you want to execute a Trade using any Referral Code that you have been referred to, click on **'Use Referral'** and enter the referral code you want to use.

Once added successfully, when you place a trade the contract will automatically apply a payout boost depending on the referral code tier.
