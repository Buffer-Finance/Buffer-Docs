# How to connect to the app?

### **Step 1: Setup Wallet**

If you're new to DeFi, you will need to install and set up a non-custodial wallet, that allows you to directly connect and interact with the dApp. For the purpose of this guide, we will be using MetaMask as an example.

Follow this [guide](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531-Getting-started-with-MetaMask) to install and set up your MetaMask wallet.

### Step 2: ETH/MATIC for Gas

All transaction fees on Arbitrum are payable in ETH and all transactions on Polygon are payable in MATIC. You will need Arbitrum ETH/ Polygon MATIC in your wallet to start trading or liquidity provisioning on Buffer.

You can buy ETH/MATIC directly on Arbitrum using [Uniswap(Arbitrum)](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap). Alternatively, if you hold ETH/MATIC on other networks, you can use cross-chain bridges to transfer ETH to Arbitrum or MATIC to Polygon.

You can use the following options for transferring ETH to Arbitrum or MATIC to Polygon:

* [Anyswap](https://anyswap.exchange/#/bridge)
* [Transferto](https://transferto.xyz/)
* [Bungee](https://bungee.exchange/)
* [Connext](https://bridge.connext.network/)
* [Native(Arbitrum)](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?l2ChainId=42161)
* [Celer](https://cbridge.celer.network/)
* [Rango Exchange](https://app.rango.exchange/swap/BSC.BNB/ARBITRUM.BFR--0x1a5b0aaf478bf1fda7b934c76e7692d722982a6d)

#### **Step 3: Connect to the dApp**

Navigate to [https://buffer.finance/](https://buffer.finance/). If you want to trade on Buffer, click on **'Trade'**, and if you want to provide liquidity to the USDC vault or stake your BFR tokens, then click on **'Earn Yield'**

Click on the **'Connect'** button on the top right-hand corner of the UI (if you’re on the “Trade” page, you can also click on the larger **'Connect Wallet'** button on the lower right of the trading dashboard).

You can then select between different wallets - (MetaMask, Coin98, Trust Wallet, Wallet Connect, Rainbow, Ledger live, Omni, Imtoken). Select your wallet type and confirm.

### **Switching between networks**

Once you’ve connected your wallet you will be connected to the Arbitrum network by default, if you want to interact on Buffer - Polygon, you can easily switch between the two networks on Buffer, by clicking on the network button on the top right-hand corner of the interface.
