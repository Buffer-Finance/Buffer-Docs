# How to connect to the app?

## Connecting to Buffer Finance - Arbitrum

### Step 1: Setup Wallet

If you're new to DeFi, you will need to install and setup a non-custodial wallet, that allows you to directly connect and interact with the dApp. 
For the purpose of this guide, we will be using MetaMask as an example.

Follow this [guide](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531-Getting-started-with-MetaMask) to install and setup your MetaMask wallet.

### Add Arbitrum Network to your wallet

Buffer Finance is live on Arbitrum and Polygon. To connect to Buffer on Arbitrum you'll need to add the chain's information to MetaMask, if not already added. This includes a chain ID, custom RPC URL, and network name. To add an Arbitrum token, you’ll also need to import the right token address.

To do that open your MetaMask wallet.  Click on the dropdown menu and choose “Add Network”

Add the following RPC details:
- Network Name: Arbitrum
- RPC URL: https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
- Chain ID: 42161
- Symbol: ETH
- Block Explorer URL: https://arbiscan.io/
-
And then Click “Save”

## Step 2: ETH for Gas fees

All transaction fees on Arbitrum are payable in ETH. You will need Arbitrum ETH in your wallet to start trading or liquidity provisioning on Buffer. 

You can buy ETH directly on Arbitrum using [Uniswap(Arbitrum)](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap). Alternatively, if you hold ETH on other networks, you can use cross-chain bridges to transfer ETH to Arbitrum.
You can use the following options for transferring ETH to Arbitrum:

- [Anyswap](https://anyswap.exchange/#/bridge)
- [Transferto](https://transferto.xyz/)
- [Bungee](https://bungee.exchange/)
- [Connext](https://bridge.connext.network/)
- [Native(Arbitrum)](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?l2ChainId=42161)
- [Celer](https://cbridge.celer.network/)
- [Rango Exchange](https://app.rango.exchange/swap/BSC.BNB/ARBITRUM.BFR--0x1a5b0aaf478bf1fda7b934c76e7692d722982a6d)


### Step 3: Connect to the dApp
Navigate to https://buffer.finance/

If you want to trade on Buffer, click on **'Trade'**, and if you want to provide liquidity to the USDC vault or stake your BFR tokens, then click on **'Earn Yield'**
