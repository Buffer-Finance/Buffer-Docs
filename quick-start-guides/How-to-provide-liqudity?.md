# How to provide liqudity?

All transaction fees on Arbitrum are payable in ETH. If you’re new to the Arbitrum ecosystem, you will have to buy/swap some ETH to your Arbitrum wallet address.

## To provide liquidity on Buffer:

### Step 1: Go to https://app.buffer.finance/#/earn and connect your wallet

### Step 2: Navigate to the USDC (BLP Token) vault section

### Step 3: Deposit USDC to the vault

Check the USDC to BLP:USDC exchange rate and the vault APR. Once ready to deposit, click on the “Add Funds” button.

A pop-up window will appear, enter the chosen amount of USDC you want to provide as liquidity. Note there a deposit limit has been implemented on the BLP vault for LP risk management. The current pool cap is 2M USDC, however this will be increased gradually as the protocol trading volume grows.

_Note: If this is the first time you are depositing a particular asset on Buffer, the deposit form will contain a request for permission to use your tokens by clicking on "Approve". You need to make this transaction only at the first deposit for each asset. In case you later revoke the authorization, you will have to approve using tokens again at the next deposit. Once approved, the “Add Funds” button will become available, click on it and confirm the transaction._

**After the transaction is successful, you will be able to see the amount of BLP minted on your USDC investment on the Vault card. The minted BLP token is automatically staked, and you will start earning 55% of the trading (platform) fees and esBFR rewards.**
