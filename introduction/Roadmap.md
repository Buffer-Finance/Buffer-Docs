# Roadmap

## Buffer’s short-term to mid-term roadmap for 2023

### Product Development Roadmap

**Here’s a quick breakdown of the items on the product development roadmap:**

#### Up/Down options: 
Up/Down options completely abstract the complexities of funding rates, fee calculations, liquidations, or collateral management. A trader can trade by selecting the time duration and the direction (Up/Down) to receive a pre-defined payout. The Up/Down options trading platform is already live on Arbitrum mainnet and supports multiple cryptocurrency and forex pairs. We’ll soon add support for commodities and indices Up/Down trading on the mainnet. 

#### No-loss tournaments:
No-loss tournaments are gamified Up/Down trading competitions that allow new traders to enter the arena via small entry fees and compete using play tokens to win pre-defined rewards. Although the essence of these tournaments is to allow the best traders to win the trophy, they can also be used as great training or strategy testing avenues. 

#### Above/Below binary options:
There are only two possible outcomes (above or below the selected strike price) around a single strike price of the said asset. The above and below options are defined by the underlying asset of choice, strike price, and expiration/maturity date. 

#### Knockouts:
A product built on top of leading derivative protocols, including GMX and Gains network, knockout options offer leveraged positions with guaranteed stop loss and take profit. Knockout options are extremely useful for specific hedging strategies. 

#### Multi-chain deployment:
On EVM-compatible chains that offer sustainability and a burgeoning ecosystem to facilitate higher trading activity and LP incentivization. Currenlty Buffer Finance is live on Arbitrum and Polygon.

#### OTM options as ladder interface:
A ladder interface to support longer timeframes. Preferred by experienced long-term traders, the ladder interface is known for its ease of use while allowing you to create strategies with trailing stops, etc. 

### Community Growth Roadmap

**Here’s a quick breakdown of the items on our community growth roadmap:**

#### Weekly and daily trading leagues: to promote consistency in trading and incentivize higher volumes 

#### Buffer Prime Club NFTs: a collection of community commemorative NFTs that offer exclusive real utility such as higher pay-outs (boosts), access to trading strategy discussion groups, access to bigger price pools in trading leagues, and discounted access to no-loss tournaments. 

#### Gamification: Referral Program (live on testnet), LeaderBoard, Trader Profiles, and Social Sharing

#### Partnerships:
- Liquidity incentivization over new Dex and Uni V3 liquidity management protocols like Camelot, 3xCalibur, Diamond Protocol, and Demeter by Sperax 
- NFT whitelisting events with other Defi protocols and DAOs to reach out to their community
- GMX Blueberry Club

#### Global community building and partnerships across regions including Brazil, South Korea, EU nations, Vietnam, Japan, and more.

#### Focus on Composability: a major focus of this roadmap will be leveraging composability to provide new tools both to users and other teams. Here are some features built using the synergy between different DeFi protocols:
- Knockout options will be built on top of GMX and Gain trade
- Copy trading vaults
- One trade execution with STFX
- Using Buffer protocol to hedge position on GMX
