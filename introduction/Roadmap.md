# Roadmap

## Buffer’s short-term to mid-term roadmap for 2023

### Product Development Roadmap

**Here’s a quick breakdown of the items on the product development roadmap:**

#### Up/Down options: 
Up/Down options completely abstract the complexities of funding rates, fee calculations, liquidations, or collateral management. A trader can trade by selecting the time duration and the direction (Up/Down) to receive a pre-defined payout. The Up/Down options trading platform is already live on Arbitrum mainnet and supports multiple cryptocurrency and forex pairs. 1 min and 30-sec timeframes for Up/Down trading are coming soon on Buffer, currently, 5 min to 4-hour timeframes are available on the mainnet.

#### No-loss tournaments:
No-loss tournaments are gamified Up/Down trading competitions that allow new traders to enter the arena via small entry fees and compete using play tokens to win pre-defined rewards. Although the essence of these tournaments is to allow the best traders to win the trophy, they can also be used as great training or strategy testing avenues. 

#### Above/Below binary options:
Unlike Up/Down options, where the two possible outcomes are determined around the current market price of the asset, in Above/below options, the two outcomes are generated around a single strike price of the underlying. Above and below options are defined by the underlying asset of choice, strike price, and expiration/maturity date. 

#### Knockouts:
A product built on top of leading derivative protocols, including GMX and Gains network, knockout options offer leveraged positions with guaranteed stop loss and take profit. Knockout options are extremely useful for specific hedging strategies. 

#### Multi-chain deployment:
On EVM-compatible chains that offer sustainability and a burgeoning ecosystem to facilitate higher trading activity and LP incentivization. Currenlty Buffer Finance is live on Arbitrum and Polygon.

#### OTM options as ladder interface:
A ladder interface to support longer timeframes. Preferred by experienced long-term traders, the ladder interface is known for its ease of use while allowing you to create strategies with trailing stops, etc. 

#### UX optimization & Customizability features:
- 1 click trading: the 1 click trading feature abstracts a users interaction with a wallet while trading. This reduces the number of button clicks required to place a trade, enhance execution time and improves the overall trader expereince on the platform. 1 click trading feature is currently under beta testing. 

- Multicharts: the features allows traders to open multiple charts on different trading pairs, allowing traders to fully customize the UI to according to their trading needs.(live on testnet)
