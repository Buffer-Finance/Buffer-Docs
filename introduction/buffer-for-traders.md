# Buffer For Traders

Traders can trade price volatility by simply selecting their prediction about the price of an asset in a given time frame. For example, a trader can estimate whether the price of the said asset can go UP or DOWN in the next 15 mins and then place an order to win a pre-defined payout.

The payouts are typically about 1.4 -1.9x of the pay-in and can be further boosted by holding the Optopi NFTs or using a referral code.
