# Buffer For Traders

Traders can trade price volatility by selecting their prediction about the price of an asset in a given time frame, for example, whether it can go up or down in the next 15 mins, and then place their order to win a pre-defined payout.&#x20;

The payouts are typically about 1.4-1.9x of the pay-in and can be further boosted by holding any of the Buffer Prime Club NFTs or using a referral link or referral code.  &#x20;

**Key benefits of using Buffer Finance for Trading**

1. No liquidation&#x20;
2. Pre-defined risk-reward
3. No funding rates
4. Simple interface
