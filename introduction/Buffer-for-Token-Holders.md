## BY depositing BFR tokens in the [vault](https://app.buffer.finance/#/earn), stakers will start earning staking rewards paid continuously as:

- USDC: up to 40% of the protocol revenue generated is sent to $BFR stakers;

- esBFR: Can be claimed and vested or compounded for more rewards, similar to BFR token staking;

- Multiplier points: can be staked to boost APR (a.k.a real yield).
