# Buffer for Token Holders

### Token Information:

Contract Address: 0x1A5B0aaF478bf1FDA7b934c76E7692D722982a6D

After staking BFR, you will receive a staked BFR token: [0xd2D1162512F927a7e282Ef43a362659E4F2a728F](https://arbiscan.io/token/0xd2D1162512F927a7e282Ef43a362659E4F2a728F) (Arbitrum).&#x20;

Note that the balance for this will return your total staked amount including any esBFR tokens and Multiplier Points.

### BY depositing BFR tokens in the vault, stakers will start earning staking rewards paid continuously as:

* USDC: up to 40% of the protocol revenue generated is sent to $BFR stakers;
* esBFR: Can be claimed and vested or compounded for more rewards, similar to BFR token staking;
* Multiplier points: can be staked to boost APR (a.k.a real yield).

Use the "Rewards" page to learn more about esBFR and Multiplier points.
