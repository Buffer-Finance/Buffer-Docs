[Optopi](https://optopi.buffer.finance/) is a collection of 8,888 unique, collectible PFP-friendly NFTs on Arbitrum it offers key utility to traders on the Buffer Finance Platform. The Optopi collection is divided into four tiers:  Diamond, Platinum, Gold, and Silver. Diamond is the rarest to mint, and Silver is the most common. 

## NFT Utility

### 1. Payout Boost for Up/Down options

On Buffer, each trading pair has its own base payout (less volatile pairs => higher base payout & more volatile pairs => lower base payout). 
The boost % depends on the tier of the NFT being held (highest tier = max payout boost, lowest tier = least payout boost).

Here’s how the NFT boost/NFT tier affects the base payout for traders:

|    Tiers    |   Payout Boost     |
| ----------- | -----------------  |
|   Silver    |        2.5%        |                     
|    Gold     |        5%          | 
|   Platinum  |        8%          |
|   Diamond   |        12%         |

NFT payout are automatically applied when a trader holding an Optopi opens a trade on Buffer. 
The contracts checks for a NFT, and it's tier and automatically the payout boost on the open trade.


### 2. Access to Trading leagues:

Trading leagues are weekly contests where top traders can win USDC rewards based on their performance, depending on the past week's trading activity. A trader can be part of any of the five leagues Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond. With Diamond having the highest reward and Bronze having the lowest.

Optopi NFT holders get direct access according to their NFT tier. So platinum Optopi holders get free access to the platinum league and so on. On the other hand, non-Optopi holders will have to fulfill the eligibility criteria (based on the past week’s performance) to enter the higher leagues.

_Note: the bronze league is dedicated to non-NFT holders starting with trading on the Buffer platform and do not have a trading history._
