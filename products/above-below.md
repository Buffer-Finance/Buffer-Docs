# Above/below

## Above/below

Above/below options work similarly to Up/Down Options, abstracting the complexity of options trading into two simple outcomes. Here are only two possible outcomes (above or below the selected strike price) around a single strike price of the said asset. Hence, above and below options are defined by the underlying asset of choice, strike price, and expiration/maturity date.
