### Short-term options trading platform

Buffer Finance is a non-custodial exotic options trading platform offering defined-risk and fast-paced trading over crypto and non-crypto markets (like forex, commodities, and indices).

Buffer moves beyond the traditional design of decentralized derivatives to focus on abstracting complexity from DeFi options and striking a balance between traders and liquidity providers. With Buffer, DeFi-native traders can trade multiple assets completely on-chain with pre-defined outcomes and without the added complexity of liquidation, funding rates, or scam-wicks.

All trades are placed against a liquidity pool, liquidity providers can provide liquidity to earn a part of the platform fee generated by trading activity and esBFR token incentives for taking the counterparty risk.

#### **Gamification**

Buffer protocol can also be used by players who want to play for fun and win rewards by participating in our no-loss tournaments, where they can join by paying an entry fee and win prizes by competing with other tournament participants. The protocol will also host more performance-based competitive tournaments via trading leagues and Optopi NFT-based tournaments.

#### **The Future of Buffer Finance**

As the ecosystem grows - BLP and trading activities increase on Buffer, the volume benefits for Buffer users will be compounding. As the project evolves, we will guide the protocol towards full decentralization and community governance (by BFR holders) and empower projects to list their tokens without any intervention by the Buffer Finance Team.

The possibilities for expansion are limitless, and we expect many more use cases for Buffer that we have yet to discover.
