### Short-term options trading platform

Buffer Finance is a non-custodial exotic options trading platform offering defined-outcome and fast-paced trading over crypto and non-crypto markets (like forex, commodities, and indices).

Buffer abstracts complexity from options trading and lets DeFi-native traders trade multiple assets completely on-chain without the added complexity of liquidation, funding rates, or scam-wicks.

All trades are placed against a liquidity pool, liquidity providers can provide liquidity and take the counterparty risk to earn a part of the platform fee and esBFR token incentives&#x20;

### **The flywheel effect**

BLP is a USDC-based single asset pool, which acts as the clearing house for options traders. Since LPs act as the counterparty to options traders, they earn both trading fees and mark-to-market PnL as position takers. If options traders' net positions lose money, LPs benefit from the distribution of wealth effects.&#x20;

More BLP liquidity in turn allows the Buffer platform to support higher trade size which generated higher protocol volume. This in turn results in more fees for BLP and BFR stakers and more incentives to mint BLP and increase the BFR floor.&#x20;

Given the zero-sum structure, the trader’s PnL shows how much PnL liquidity providers make in comparison to holding USDC in the pool. As of March 2022, traders had a cumulative loss of 757K USD. which has been distributed to LPs as profit. &#x20;

Additionally, as trading activity grows, Buffer can churn significant liquidity multiple times during a single trading cycle between timeframes of 5 mins to 4 hours.

BFR is the platform’s native token that has both utility and governance functions. Staked BFR earns 40% of fees generated from the platform’s trading fees in contrast to BLP which accrues 55% of the fees (the remaining 5% is reserved for traders who participate in the Buffer Weekly trading contests).&#x20;

Staked BFR and staked BLP both also earn esBFR rewards that can be vested over a year to be converted into liquid BFR tokens. This design allows the protocol to grow sustainably without the constant selling pressure.&#x20;
